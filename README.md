# make_your_own_email_marketing

# Programming Language used:

    HTML AND CSS
    To initialize run the file make_your_own_email_marketing.html in your browser

# About the program:

  This is an example of how a responsive email marketing campaign can be created specifically for Gmail. It can be customized as per your requirements. I'll provide an example image and some tips/attempts that I made to enhance this template:

# NOTES:

- In the browser version, when I attach the URL of an image hosted on a server, it shows up. However, in the web version, it doesn't. To try and solve this issue, I attempted to work with base64 encoding (https://base64.guru/), but it didn't work.
- Pure SVG code in the email body didn't work well either.
- Gmail apparently has protection against this type of code.
- The formatting of the blue text appears as desired only when opened on a mobile device, as can be seen in the image below:"

# OBSERVATION:

I hope this structure helps you in some way, as for the comments, it's more for testing purposes, the right thing to do is to use an appropriate image hosting service. Any information to contribute will be welcome
